Oldairy 1.0.1 - Released on September 11th, 2023.

Additions:

* Three new settings on the settings page:
 * `Allow Use of Precise Minutes` - force minutes to be more precise by rounding them;
 * `Enable Time Rounding` - convert raw cooling time value to a human-readable form;
 * `Cooling Coefficient` - although an experimental feature, allow change of default cooling coefficient value to something more situation-appropriate;
* Implement a `TimeFormatter` class which can be used for extracting hours and minutes from raw cooling time value.

Changes:

* Re-enable time rounding feature which was previously disabled due to inadequacy of the previous implementation;
* Remove any kind of time formatting from `Calculator` class;
* Upgrade Flutter from version `3.3.5` to `3.10.6`;
* Upgrade Gradle from version `7.4.0` to `7.6.2`.

Fixes:

* Fix a critical bug that causes cooling time to be completely imprecise upon a calculation due to missing hour reset routine.
